# Geo-Spatial Retail Expansion Optimizer

**A “find-your-next-store” demo that turns free map and census data into clear, ranked expansion opportunities—complete with interactive maps and tables.**

## 🚀 What It Is (Layman’s Terms)

Imagine deciding where to open your next coffee shop in minutes instead of months. This tool:

1. **Counts nearby hotspots** (using OpenStreetMap POIs as a proxy for foot traffic).  
2. **Checks local demographics** (population size & income via the Census ACS).  
3. **Measures competition** (free-tier Foursquare/Yelp lookups).  
4. **Crunches it all into one “opportunity score”** so you can instantly rank any number of candidate sites.  
5. **Shows results on an interactive map & sortable table** in a simple Streamlit dashboard.

## 🎯 Key Features

- **Modular Connectors**: Swap OSMnx for SafeGraph (or any vendor) with one config change.  
- **Zero-Cost Data**: Built on open data (OSM, Census) and open-source libraries.  
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Streamlit + Folium gives you map + table with one-click deploy to their free tier.  
- **Clustering & Insights**: scikit-learn KMeans surfaces geographic hotspots.
